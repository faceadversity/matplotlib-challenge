# Matplotlib Analysis of Anti-Cancer Medications
What good is data without a good plot to tell the story? In this assignment, we will get to see intuitive applications of Matplotlib to any real-world situation and will include datasets bridging it all together as a cohesive unit.
# Background
After seeking and getting employment at Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications; I have been assigned as a Senior Data Analyst at the company! Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. I have been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured by myself and other notable specialists of varying skilled backgrounds within the company. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked me with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked for my top-level summary of the study results.
